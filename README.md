## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project aimed at classifying EEG data to assist in diagnosing neurological conditions. The project involves preprocessing EEG datasets, extracting features, and evaluating various models including Decision Trees, CNNs, and LSTMs.

## Datasets
- CHB-MIT EEG Database
- Bonn EEG Dataset

## Repository Contents
- `EEG_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing and exploration.
- `EEG_Feature_Extraction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for feature extraction from EEG signals.
- `EEG_Model_Evaluation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing model evaluation and comparison.
- `models/`: Directory containing trained model files.
- `data/`: Directory containing raw and preprocessed data sets.
